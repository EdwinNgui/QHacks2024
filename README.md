>Transforming tennis footage with AI insights from ChatGPT and statistical analysis. ðŸŽ¾
Elevate your game with dynamic visuals and strategic summaries. ðŸš€

## Inspiration
Our inspiration for TRACY came from the desire to enhance tennis training through advanced technology. One of our members was a former tennis enthusiast who has always strived to refine their skills. They soon realized that the post-game analysis process took too much time in their busy schedule. We aimed to create a system that not only analyzes gameplay but also provides personalized insights for players to improve their skills.

## What It Does and How It Works
TRACY utilizes computer vision algorithms and pre-trained neural networks to analyze tennis footage, tracking player movements, and ball trajectories. The system then employs ChatGPT for AI-driven insights, generating personalized natural language summaries highlighting players' strengths and weaknesses. The output includes dynamic visuals and statistical data, offering a comprehensive overview and further insights into the player's performance.
