## What It Does and How It Works
TRACY utilizes computer vision algorithms and pre-trained neural networks to analyze tennis footage, tracking player movements, and ball trajectories. The system then employs ChatGPT for AI-driven insights, generating personalized natural language summaries highlighting players' strengths and weaknesses. The output includes dynamic visuals and statistical data, offering a comprehensive overview and further insights into the player's performance.
